        <h2>What is C++?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s). C++ is so compatible with C that it will probably compile over 99% of C programs without changing a line of source code. Though C++ is a lot of well-structured and safer language than C as it OOPs based.</p>
        <h2>Is C++ best programming language?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The answer depends on perspective and requirements. Some tasks can be done in C++, though not very quickly. For example, designing GUI screens for applications.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Other languages like Visual Basic, Python have GUI design elements built into them. Therefore, they are better suited for GUI type of task.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Some of the scripting languages that provide extra programmability to applications. Such as MS Word and even photoshop tend to be variants of Basic, not C++.</p>
        <h2>Why uses C++?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">C++ is a fully object-oriented programming language compatible with C. Classes and objects created as design entities can be implemented directly using C++ language constructs. C++ code can be linked with existing C code for maximum reuse of an application's legacy code and existing C libraries.</p>
        <h2>What makes C++ unique?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">C++ is a general-purpose programming language, created by Bjarne Stroustrup and his team at Bell Laboratories in 1979. Over the decades, C++ has become the language of choice for certain kinds of applications.</p>
        <p class="post-text">C++ is most popularly used for building large software infrastructure and applications that run on limited resources. Because C++ can directly manipulate the hardware (or machine) that it runs on, programmers can fine-tune their code to run efficiently in any environment, even when there’s limited hardware space or energy available to power the application. This translates to applications that run quickly and reliably on a variety of devices, making C++ ideal for forming the base layer of many important applications.</p>
        <p class="post-text">For these reasons, C++ is an excellent choice for building software that is fast, efficient at managing system resources, and reliable in performing critical tasks.</p>
        <h2>What Is C++ Used For?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">C++ can be found just about everywhere you look. It powers search engines, VR applications, air travel, movie production, and even exploration on Mars! In fact, C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages there is.</p>
        <p class="post-text">In this article, we’ll take a look at what makes C++ unique and dive into a variety of real-world applications. If you’re interested in learning more about the fundamental programming concepts behind C++, check out our Learn C++ course to get started.</p>
        <h2>Operating systems</h2>
        <p class="post-text">C++ plays an important part in well-known operating systems, from MacOS and Windows to mobile operating systems like iOS. In general, operating systems need to be fast and efficient at managing system resources. With the low-level (close to machine code) capabilities of C++, developers can structure their code to make even the smallest details of an operating system fast and energy efficient.</p>
        <h2>Game development</h2>
        <p class="post-text">C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages in game development. It has been used to create: games, such as World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike, and StarCraft, game engines like Unreal Engine, and gaming consoles, including Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Gaming involves lots of resource-intensive functions, whether it’s generating graphics or facilitating multiplayer sessions. C++ helps in optimizing the use of resources, such as allowing programmers to adjust exactly how data structures and memory allocation are handled.  </p>
        <h2>Databases</h2>
        <p class="post-text">C++ is used to build popular database tools like MySQL and MongoDB. These databases form the backbone of many well-known applications, including ones created by Google, Netflix, YouTube, Adobe, and more. C++ is ideal for helping structure databases to support efficient storage.</p>
        <h2>Web browsers</h2>
        <p class="post-text">C++ plays a role in web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Opera. It is used to develop back-end services that retrieve information from databases and render code into interactive web pages. C++ helps web browsers carry out these tasks with speed and minimal delays, which means we don’t have to wait long for content to appear on our screens.</p>
        <h2>Machine learning tools</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Machine learning tools, such as TensorFlow, rely on C++ as a back-end programming language. Even though data scientists can use TensorFlow with Python, for example, the core machine learning calculations are carried out with C++ code. In fact, C++ has a large collection of libraries that power these highly-sophisticated calculations that train machine learning models.</p>
