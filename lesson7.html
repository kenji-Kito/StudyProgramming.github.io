       <h2>How to Run Python Scripts: Step by Step Guide</h2>
       <h2>What is the Script in Python?</h2>
       <p class="post-text1">A script in Python can be defined as a file that consists of Python code or a program. It ends with an extension as .py</p>
       <p class="post-text1">An interpreter can execute a script in two distinct ways, as listed below: –</p>
       <p class="post-text1">>> A script can be executed as a module or as a script itself.</p>
       <p class="post-text1">>> A code that is written in an interactive Python command prompt session manner.</p>
       <h2>How to run Python code and scripts interactively?</h2>
       <p class="post-text1">Here are steps to do this:</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 1)</strong> The programmer must open the command line in the interactive mode.</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 2)</strong>  In the next step, invoke the python interpreter in the command line by typing the following command: –</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong>Command:</strong></p>
       <div>
        <pre class="code">
            <p>python</p>
        </pre>
       </div>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 3)</strong> The programmer can sequentially write Python code and execute them in the same order.</p>
       <p class="post-text1">The following program can be typed in the command line as shown below:</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong>Example: –</strong></p>

                a=25
                b=50
                 if a > b:
                ...    print ("a is more than b")
                ... else:
                ...    print ("b is more than a")
                ...
                b is more than a
                >>></p>

       <h2>How to run Python scripts from an IDE</h2>
       <p class="post-text1">An integrated development environment is also referred to as IDE in short form. It offers a virtual setup of file and folder hierarchy. It allows the programmer to build Python projects quickly. IDE provides the organization of files into different folders.</p>
       <p class="post-text1">These different folders belong to one common directory.</p>
       <p class="post-text1">Spyder and PyCharm are two Python IDEs that enable the programmer to run Python programs.</p>
       <p class="post-text1">Let us take an example of executing a Python script in PyCharm IDE:</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 1)</strong>  As the first step, create a new project in PyCharm. </p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 2)</strong>  Name the project as Guru99Example and then click create.</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 3)</strong>  Select the Root folder that would be labeled as Guru99Example and do a right click.</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 4)</strong>  Go to the new option and create a new Python file.</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 5)</strong>  Give the name of the Python file Here we have given Guru99Example.</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 6)</strong>   In the blank Python file created in PyCharm IDE, write the following piece of code as shown below: –</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong>Python Code:</strong></p>
       <div>
        <pre class="code">
            <p>print ('hello world')</p>
        </pre>
       </div>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 7)</strong>   To run the above code, right-click on the editor and select the option <strong>“Run File in Python console”</strong>.</p>
       <p class="post-text1">This code will open the console window within IDE, and the following would be the output:</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong>Output:</strong></p>
       <div>
        <pre class="code">
            <p>PyDev console: starting.

       <h2>How to run Python scripts using a file manager?</h2>
       <p class="post-text1">Here are the steps to run the Python script using file manager:</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 1)</strong>  Open Notepad and add some Python code. </p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 2)</strong>  Type print (‘Hello World’) </p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 3)</strong>   Save the script file with extension as either .py or. pyw. </p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 4)</strong>  .py extension file is used for programs that have Python.exe. </p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong> Step 5)</strong>   In the windows operating system, right-click the Python file and click open. Refer to the below </p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong>screenshot: –</strong></p>

       <p class="post-text1">To ensure the screen remains for a while, add the following statement in the Python script file as shown below: –</p>
       <p class="post-text1"><strong>Python Code:</strong></p>
       <div>
        <pre class="code">
            <p>input ('Press provide enter to exit...') </p>
        </pre>
       </div>
       <p class="post-text1">Until and unless there is no input from the user, the screen continues to run and display Python output.</p>
       <p class="post-text1">However, if the Python script has some error, the execution of the input command is interrupted or aborted. Due to this, the user may not be able to see Python script execution using file manager.</p>
