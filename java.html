        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Java?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.</p>
        <p class="post-text">While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who may still require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting Java 8. Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Why Use Java?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Java is a well-known server-side programming language that is often used for constructing web applications. Spring, Struts, Hibernate, Apache Hadoop, and JSF are among of the most popular Java frameworks for constructing Web applications.</p> 
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Is Java free to download?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Yes, Java is free to download for personal use.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Java is also free for development: developers can find all the development kits and other useful tools at <a href="https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp">https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp</a></p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Java used for?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Java fluency is undoubtedly a popular and in-demand skill. But what is the purpose of Java programming? We’ve previously touched on some Java use cases; we’ve elaborated on these and other Java examples further below. Java can be used for many things:</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Video games</h2>
        <p class="post-text">When it comes to game development, programming languages such as C# and C++ are employed by game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. Java, on the other hand, is a great choice if you want to study graphics and game development from the ground up. There are numerous frameworks and libraries available, such as LibGDX and OpenGL.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Web-based programmes</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Java is a well-known server-side programming language that is often used for constructing web applications. Spring, Struts, Hibernate, Apache Hadoop, and JSF are among of the most popular Java frameworks for constructing Web applications. Java is also used by famous websites such as LinkedIn, AliExpress, Amazon, and many others.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Big data</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Aside from Python, which is used in Big Data, there are many other popular programming languages. Even so, when it comes to Big Data Technology, most programmers prefer Java. The reason for this is that most famous Big Data tools, such as Hadoop and Deeplearning4j, use Java and its community support is excellent when it comes to Big Data Technology.</p>
        <p class="post-text">It’s also the best choice for IoT because of its adaptability and mobility, as it’s used for web development, Android development, desktop app development, and a variety of other things. Compared to other programming languages, integrating multiple technologies is easier with Java. For these reasons, is employed in automotive navigation systems, various medical gadgets, and embedded electronics.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">NASA Word Wind</h2>
        <p class="post-text">NASA developed their Word Wind using Java, creating a fully 3D virtual globe that displays geographic data. It creates 3D models of the planets using photos and aerial photography from the NASA spacecraft.</p>
        <p class="post-text">It is a Java-based open-source proprietary software that runs on all operating systems. The project utilises OpenGL API to create 2D and 3D images that interact with the graphics processor unit. It also displays data in real-time using the GPS plugin – such as clouds, hurricanes, earthquakes, and more. With this software, we may search for locations using geographical names, define visible layers and viewing angles, and much more.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Minecraft</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Minecraft is a well-known computer game created using Java. Java 1.8 is included in the Minecraft Java edition, and Minecraft uses it by default.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Java projects for beginners</h2>
        <p class="post-text">So, if you’ve ever wondered what to do with Java or who uses it, we’ve provided you with plenty of examples. But what if you’re just getting started with Java and eventually want to work as a Java developer?</p>
        <p class="post-text">Below, we’ve listed a few Java project ideas for beginners. These will help you learn more about the programming language and put your skills to the test:</p>
