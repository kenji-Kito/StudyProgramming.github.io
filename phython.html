        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Python?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Why Use Python?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Python's expansive library of open source data analysis tools, web frameworks, and testing instruments make its ecosystem one of the largest out of any programming community.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Python is an accessible language for new programmers because the community provides many introductory resources.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The TIOBE Index a long-running language ranking, has Python moving up the charts to #3, climbing from #8 just a few years ago.</p>
        <p class="post-text">These rankings provide a rough measure for language popularity. They are not intended as a precise measurement tool to determine exactly how many developers are using a language. However, the aggregate view shows that Python remains a stable programming language with a growing ecosystem.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Python's programming language popularity</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Several programming language popularity rankings exist. While it's possible to criticize that these guides are not exact, every ranking shows Python as a top programming language within the top ten, if not the top five of all languages.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The IEEE ranked Python as the #1 programming language in 2019, which continued its hot streak after ranking it #1 in 2018 and 2017. RedMonk's June 2019 ranking had Python at #3, which held consistent from previous years' rankings in 2018 and 2017.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Stack Overflow's community-created question and answer data confirms the incredible growth of the Python ecosystem and tries to determine why it growing so quickly with their own analysis. In the 2020 Stack Overflow developer survey the data indicated that Python was the fastest growing major programming language and that there is a close alignment between the languages and tools that developers choose to learn and the usage in developers' professional work.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Why does the choice of programming language matter?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Programming languages have unique ecosystems, cultures and philosophies built around them. You will find friction with a community and difficulty in learning if your approach to programming varies from the philosophy of the programming language you've selected.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Python's culture values open source software, community involvement with local, national and international events and teaching to new programmers. If those values are also important to you and/or your organization then Python may be a good fit.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The philosophy for Python is so strongly held that it's even embedded in the language as shown when the interpreter executes "import this" and displays The Zen of Python.</p>

            The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
            
            Beautiful is better than ugly.
            Explicit is better than implicit.
            Simple is better than complex.
            Complex is better than complicated.
            Flat is better than nested.
            Sparse is better than dense.
            Readability counts.
            Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
            Although practicality beats purity.
            Errors should never pass silently.
            Unless explicitly silenced.
            In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
            There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
            Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
            Now is better than never.
            Although never is often better than *right* now.
            If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
            If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
            Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
